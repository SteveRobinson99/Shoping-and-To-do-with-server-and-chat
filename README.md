# Shoping-and-To-do-with-server-and-chat
First, I'm doing it with a server and SocketIO for chat to get some expereince with AWS and then I may rebuild a serverless version.
I'm using react native stack navigator as I haven't used that particular navigator, similarly I'm using vector icons to eperience that icon set.
Uses login.trim - which removes leading or trailing spaces - to disallow empty login, and display message using Alert.
